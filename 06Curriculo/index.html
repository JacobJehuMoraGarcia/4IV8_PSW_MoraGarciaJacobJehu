                            Hi Im Jacob Mora, i like to be chilling all day playing musical instruments or videogames. Im into compsing thrash lyrics,
                            being inspired of bands like slayer, Soad, Megadeath and some power metal bands as Stratovarisu, Helloween or newer bands like: Avantasia, 
                             Nightwish and Lovebites.
                             Im studying now at CECyT 9 Juan de Dios Bátiz, what i find kind of stressing but not bad, when it comes to studies i prefere, reading a sci-fic 
                             book, playing some videogames with firiends or trying to make a new song, i like doing the last one the most, but i think im not ready
                             to can upload something yet to internet.
                             When it comes to talk about games I started playing when Iwas like 12 yo, but I wasnt really goood, but at the beggining of 2021 
                             i became pretty good at Empire Earth, what in my opinion is the thing where I have reach the highest in my life.

                        I have knownledge in playing rythm guitar, electrica bass, and a little keys, so in this year a friend had an idea of creating a music band, we start composing
                        some songs that weren't realeased but, the first song we uploaded was "Teenage hard sex" a single that lasts 2:38 minutes under the name of "Holbein", we composed
                        more songs but I dont continue due to artistical differences, I was searching to produce more grundge, thrash metal music, while the band was just starting as and
                        experimental rock.
